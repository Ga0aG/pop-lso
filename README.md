# pop-lso

This is a **pure-MATLAB** toolbox for POPulation-based Large-Scale Optimization (pop-lso). Specifically, the goal of this toolbox is to minimize a variety of *large-scale*, *black-box*, *single-objective*, *box-constrained*, *continuous* functions using **population-based** methods (under a *unified* interface).
